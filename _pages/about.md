I am currently a graduate student at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto. Previously, I worked with Prof. Baris Fidan at the Cooperative & Adaptive Mechatronic Systems Lab and Prof. Soo Jeon at the Waterloo Mechanical Systems & Control Lab, University of Waterloo. I received my MASc in Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering and BASc in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Waterloo in 2020 and 2022, respectively. I have experience in robotics, control, computer vision, deep learning, software development, and mechanical design through my past co-op experience, research, and other projects.

My research interests span both perception and control in robotics. In robot perception, I am interested in applying deep learning techniques to solve computer vision problems in robotic applications. My interests in control include vision-based control and adaptive control to enable robots to navigate safely in their environments.
