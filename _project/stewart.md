In this project, we designed and built an automated maze solver using a Stewart platform. This device can move a marble from its starting position to a target position through a maze. The motion of the Stewart platform are generated by six servomotors, which are controlled by an Arduino Mega board. Several infrared sensors are embedded in the maze to detect if the marble has passed certain checkpoints. Different sequences of motions are called by the control program based on where the marble is in the maze.
