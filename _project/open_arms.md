The Open Arms project aims to develop an open source low-cost educational robotic arm with 7 degrees of freedom. It was created by a group of students at the University of Waterloo as a fourth-year design project. With the open source nature and low cost taken into considerations, the goal is to allow educational institutions and the general public to produce and modify this design more easily to promote education in robotics.

### Mechanical Design
All of the mechanical components can be either manufactured by laser cutting or acquired as off-the-shelf products. These design decisions allow the robot to be built more easily by schools and the general public. All manufactured components are made out of either plywood or acrylic sheets.


### Electrical Design

### Software Design
