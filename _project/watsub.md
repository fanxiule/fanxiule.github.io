The Waterloo Submarine Racing Team is a student design team at the University of Waterloo. The team designs and builds human-powered submarine for underwater races.

I was one of the mechanical designers at the team. One major design project I worked on was to design a mounting frame to attach the propulsion and control systems.

In addition to design, I also actively participated in the manufacturing and assembly of the submarine, which helped me get exposure to different materials and manufacturing processes.
